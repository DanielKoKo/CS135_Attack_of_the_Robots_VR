# CS135_Attack_of_the_Robots_VR
A short Unity VR game where you fight robots to save your spaceship

## Project Description
* This 3-weeks project is a VR game where you get to punch robots freely in an interactive outer-space environment. It uses the most up-to-date Oculus Touch controls and allows players to perform different actions when their hands are opened or closed. 
  - Players can push robots with an open hand, and punch robots with closed fists.
* The game calculates velocity of punches and pushes based on how much force the player exerts, which is not only fun, but also an opportunity for exercise.
