A VR game where you fight robots to save your spaceship

> Created by Daniel Ko, Jose Castro, Steven Strickland, Hongan Zhang

## Project Description
* This project is a VR game where you get to punch robots freely in an interactive outer-space environment. It uses the most up-to-date Oculus Touch controls and allows players to perform different actions when their hands are opened or closed in a fist shape. 
> - Players can push robots with an open hand, and punch robots with closed fists.
* The game calculates velocity of punches and pushes based on how much force the player exerts, which is not only fun, but also an opportunity for exercise.
